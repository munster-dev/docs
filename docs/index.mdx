Munster is a javascript framework for building web applications.
This framework is based on web components which is good for encapsulating components and building micro frontend apps.
The framework is not using a virtual dom,
instead it will attache a watcher to a bindings and update it only when necessary.
This feature is what makes it fast and have a better client run-time performance and memory efficient than virtual dom.
